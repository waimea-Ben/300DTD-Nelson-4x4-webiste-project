# Requirements

## Project Requirements

### Identified Problem or Need

my project will enable alll the members and generla public to see what the club has been doing, it will also allow members to see upcoming trips as well asas put thir name down for them and locate them.

### End-User Requirements

My typical end users are older people (30-70) who need easy to read, high contrast designs with larger text.

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.
i intend to make a site/app that enables general public to view the home page and past trips, while allowing logged in users to view all the trips past and upcoming. admin users can add/delete trips as well as post trip reviews and photos for the past trips. they can also manage /add new members and change site settings

## Relevant Implications

## Usability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

### Relevance to the System

usuability is relevnat to this project because it must follow common usability heuristics and be easy to complete simple tasks

### Impact / Considerations

for my website i will Follow standard conventions (e.g. placement of menus, etc.),
Make the behaviour of the outcome logical and familiar,
Provide the end-user with a clear route forwards using obvious buttons (and back out, if needed),
Always make it obvious to the end-user what is happening by having clear page and component labels.

## End-User

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

### Relevance to the System

must be usuable for the older clients, have big buttons and text, easy to read ui
must appeal to the 4wd people
and work on a wide range of devices that theyre likely to use, pc, mobile, etc.

### Impact / Considerations

good use of icons and colour choices for contrast, good size components, and must work on mobile and pc. must make use of proffesional langauge, ands make frquent use of end user feedback to snsure apt adjustemnts.

## Aesthetics

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how it looks in terms of design.

### Relevance to the System

aesthetics is an important part of any site as it decides what the users first impression will be of the site as well as thier entire user experience.
to this site, aestetics is important as it is targeted towards an older audience who will be very particular about how hings look.

### Impact / Considerations

this implication means that i will need to ensure that my site has a very appealing colour scheme that is high contrast and allows users to be able to read all compoents and interact with them properly. also the arrangemnt of the site should be intuitive with buttons labeled as inntuitivly as possible asnd leading to the coreect place.
i shoudl also use a suitable font such as not using comic sans or times new roman, but rather a minimalists proffesional font such as quicksand or arial.

## Accessibility

The accessibility implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) involve ensuring it is available to, and can be used by, all end-users, regardless of their abilities.

### Relevance to the System

accesability is relevant to my project because the tech skills and know-how of the club varies largely so it must be able to be opened on a wide array of phones and on desktop pcs.
it should also be availiable to be used by those with hard of sight as they may be older.

### Impact / Considerations

to fully accomadte the accesability implication, i will need to ensure that all photos have an alt tag, it must also have media queries that enable it to swap between desktop and mobile sizes to accomadate for them both.

## Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

### Relevance to the System

functionality is relevant to this topic because if the site doesnt fully function, it will be very annoying to use or even not be able to be used.
it should be able to loaded quickly and run smoothly without any gltches bugs or graphical errors.

### Impact / Considerations

to achieve this i will make sure that all of the end users wishes are met, making sure that all componetns that they asked for are there and working and are able to be swapped between without any issues.
it should also be able to cope witha wide array of inputs without breaking, so it should have lots of error checking and input handling to ensure that the site remains stable and nothing breaks.

# User Experience (UX) Principles

## Usefulness

Products and systems should be genuinely useful and fulfill a real need for a group of end-users.

### Relevance to the System

the site should be actually useful to the members of the 4wd club and generalpublic by allowing them to find out more information about the club and its trips. 

### Impact / Considerations

the site shouldnt have any unnecassry blab that doesnt help anyone and should avoid anything not contributoing to the useffulness of the site such as no empty pages, dead links or other stuff.

## Desirablity

Imagery used, the identity of the product / brand, and other design elements, should all be used to evoke emotion and appreciation of the product / system.

### Relevance to the System

my site should be desireable so that users enjoy using it and feel a sense of appreciation for the site, and tell others about it.

### Impact / Considerations

ensure that the colours convey a cheerful mood, while remaining proffesional. ensure that all imagery used is of high quality and beautiful to invoke a sense of want to go on the trips. all generla icoons and design elemnts should be consistent to provide a clean well made feel.


## Findablity

Systems should be easily navigable, so end-users can find the content or functionality they need.

### Relevance to the System

my site must have every aspect be easily findable, as in when the user lands on my page they can find all the information they desire without searching to hard. all buttons should be intuituve and links should be underlined or obvious.

### Impact / Considerations

for my site to make it as findable as possible i will include search bars on the admin pages to search through the longer lists and also add very intuitive buttons and sliders.
important info will be right there on the home page easily accesible to anyone.
